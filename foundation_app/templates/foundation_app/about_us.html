            PuranChand Foundation: A Legacy of Service Puranchand Foundation is an Organization with no profit motives. The PuranChand Foundation has been established, inspired by the late former minister and freedom fighter, PuranChand Ji, who was a messiah for the poor. The people of Daltonganj Assembly constituency were captivated by his simplicity. The public knew him affectionately as 'Ghasite Ka Kotha', 'Dharmshale Ka Lota', and 'Pinku Ka Ota'. PuranChand Ji represented the Daltonganj Assembly constituency four times consecutively (1967, 1969, 1972, 1977). His contributions can never be forgotten. PuranChand was born on Kartik Purnima in 1925. At just 14 years old, he was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and dedicated himself to the country's independence. When PuranChand was imprisoned on August 31, 1942, during the struggle for freedom, he was less than 17 years old. Later, when he was jailed during the Emergency on June 29, 1975, he was nearing 50.

                A Staunch Opponent of Injustice: From before independence, against foreign rule, to after independence, against the Congress-led government of Indira Gandhi, PuranChand Ji displayed the same fierce opposition. His intensity against the British policies was matched by his intensity against the policies of the Congress government. PuranChand had such a strong hold among the public that people would sing songs like, "Your eyes may burst, Congressmen, but the vote goes to PuranChand." He came to be known as "Puran isn't just a name, he's a storm; the Gandhi of Chota Nagpur."

                Life in Prison and Lohia's Influence: He was imprisoned countless times, from the British rule to the Congress rule, considering it his second home. He used to say that one of his feet was always in jail, and Ward No. Six of Daltonganj Jail was his permanent abode. PuranChand Ji was deeply influenced by Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia's personality. This can be seen in his traits: struggling spirit, grassroots connection with people, and strong determination. In 1977, PuranChand Ji served as the Minister of Mines in the Karpoori Thakur cabinet. This great warrior of the socialist movement breathed his last on July 30, 2001.
